"""How different two screenshots are, in pixels, with nothing but the standard
library, because the container this runs in has no image library and a
refactor is judged by its pictures.

    python3 tools/pngdiff.py before.png after.png            # the numbers
    python3 tools/pngdiff.py before.png after.png --max 0.5  # exit 1 over half a percent

Two fixed step renders of the same scene are NOT byte identical: the spark
ring is claimed with atomics on the GPU and a software rasteriser's thread
order differs run to run, so a handful of pixels move every time (measured:
19 of 1024000 on the order picture). The check is therefore a SHARE of pixels
that differ by more than a threshold, held against that noise floor, and not
`cmp`. A refactor that moves code and changes no behaviour stays under the
floor; one that changed a colour, a position or a count does not.

Only the PNG shapes Bevy's screenshot writes are handled: 8 bit RGB or RGBA,
no interlace, one IDAT stream. Anything else is refused by name.
