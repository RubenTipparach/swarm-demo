"""The shape of the code: how long every file and every function is.

A file thousands of lines long is a file nobody can hold in their head, and a
function hundreds of lines long is a function nobody can test. This measures
both, lists the worst, and with `--check` fails on anything over the limits
CLAUDE.md sets, so the limit is a check and not a promise.

    python3 tools/shape.py            # the report
    python3 tools/shape.py --check    # exit 1 on anything over a limit

A function's length is counted by matching braces from its `fn` line, so the
doc comment above it is not charged to it and neither is the whitespace
between two functions. Lines are lines: comments count, because a two hundred
line function with a hundred lines of comment is still two hundred lines to
scroll past.
